# Zombie Run Project
This is one of the first AR health apps developped for IOS. Our goal was to bring a more interactive and immersive way to promote health and fitness. In this app, users must run to avoid the zombies that are pursuing them. Run too slow or you'll be overcome by the zombies. This app is always pushing you to be aware of your surroundings and to constantly keep you heart rate up.

## Inspiration
We wanted to build a fun and immersive game using ARKit that would encourage users to 'get a move on' - in this case, running away from zombies that chase you!

##  What it does
It uses positional tracking and health kit to populate your surrounding with zombies that chase you down. You need to run away from them to survive. If they reach you and attack, the game ends.

## How we built it
ZombieRun was built using Unity for iOS with ARKit and HealthKit.

## Challenges we ran into
Plane detection, 3D modeling and animation, interfacing with HealthKit through Unity, and maintaining positional tracking when running with ARKit were a few of the challenges we ran into.

## What's next for zombierun
Adding more gameplay elements, like waypoints, rewards, and items in the game
Adding multiplayer and leaderboards - ie, who can run the longest/furthest among your friends
